**Algebraic analysis** is an area of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") that deals with systems of [linear partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") by using [sheaf theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_theory "Sheaf theory") and [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis") to study properties and generalizations of [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") such as [hyperfunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfunction "Hyperfunction") and microfunctions. 

Semantically, it is the application of algebraic operations on analytic quantities. 

As a research programme, it was started by the Japanese mathematician [Mikio Sato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikio_Sato "Mikio Sato") in 1959.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_analysis#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKashiwaraKawai201111%E2%80%9317-1) 

This can be seen as an algebraic geometrization of analysis. It derives its meaning from the fact that the differential operator is right-invertible in several function spaces.
