## Basic mathematics concepts

### Statistics basis

Some satistical concepts can be defined as result of an special optimization.


- Maximum
  
- Quantile


- Median

- Mode(众数)
  

  

  
- Mean
  Minimize the $L^1$ norm.
- Variance
  Minimize the $L^2$ norm.

- Central tendency
  Median always lies between the Mode and Mean.
- Box Plot

### Metric

- $L^p$ norm.
- Nominal data.
  Define the number of coordinates with different value as the metric.
- Boolean Data.
  For the Boolean Data, we can define the correct or incorrect classification probability as the metric.

  > - Symmetric cases.
  >   Define it as
  >
  >   $$
  >   d(x_i, x_j) = \frac{r + s}{q + r + s + t}
  >   $$
  >
  >   And in this case, the correct probability is also defined by the fraction of number.
  > - non-Symmetric
  >   Define it as
  >
  >   $$
  >   d(x_i, x_j) = \frac{r + s}{q + r + t}
  >   $$
  >
  >   Considering

  >   $$
  >   d(x_i, x_j) = \frac{q}}{q + r + s}
  >   $$
