## 8.1 Inner Products

Firstly, we give the basic definition of *inner products*, which is just a special binary map from [[Vector Space]] to $\mathbb K$, as [[Inner Product]].


## 8.2 The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

One can define a special [[Norm]] corresponding to the [[Inner Product]], which is just the [[Induced Norm of Inner Product]]. The [[Induced Norm of Inner Product]] provides the truth that every [[Inner-product Space]] can be also a [[Normed Space]].

The [[Induced Norm of Inner Product]] satisfies [[Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality]], which provides a powerful tool for inequality. The [[Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality]] can be also described as *the norm of inner product is less than the product of norms*.



## 8.3 Properties of  Induced Norm of Inner Products

Here, we give some basic properties of [[Induced Norm of Inner Product]]. Including the [[Parallelogram law]], the [[Polarisation identity]].

What's more, use the [[Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality]] and the [[Multi-Additivity]], one can derive the binary map has the [[Sequential Continuity]].

## 8.4 Hilbert Spaces

Finally, we give the concept [[Inner-product Space]] just as another view of the construction of [[Normed Space]]. Thus, the [[Completeness]] induces the concept of [[Hilbert Space]].
