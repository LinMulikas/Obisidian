1. Positive Definite.
	It's clearly positive, and for a zero map, its value is exactly zero. Consider the inverse, if $\|T\|_B = 0$, then for every $M > 0$, $\|T x\|_Y \le M\|x\|$, which implies $\|Tx\|_Y = 0$. And the definite of $\|\cdot\|_Y$ provides $T$ is zero map.

2. Linearity.

3. Traingle Inequality.
Considering $T, F$ are two maps in $L(X, Y)$. And $\|T\|_B + \|F\|_B$ is clearly an upper bound, thus the inferior of $T + F$ is no larger than $\|T\|_B + \|F\|_B$, which implies $\|T + F\|_B \le \|T\|_B + \|F\|_B$.
