Here, we claim that all the [[Vector Space]] without more discription in this chapter is [[Normed Space]].

## 1. Bounded Linear Map

First, we define [[Bounded Linear Map]] between two [[Normed Space]] by limiting the image has the same *increasing order* with preimage. 

Then, after the definition of [[Bounded Linear Map]], one should check the following properties. 

1. Considering the [[Category]] of [[Linear Map]] between [[Normed Space]], [[Bounded Linear Map]] is equivalent to [[Continuous Linear Map]].

2. Considering the [[Category]] of [[Linear Map]] between [[Normed Space]], a map with [[Finite Dimension]] domain must be [[Bounded Linear Map]]. See also [[(Lemma) Linear Map is Bounded]].

Then we define the *operator norm* of a [[Linear Map]] by the inferior of the *increasing order*. One can check that  the [[Operator Norm]] is a [[Norm]] of [[Bounded Linear Map Space]].

One can use the [[Unit Ball]] to get a equivalent definition of the [[Operator Norm]], but with the view of superior of the image.




## 2. Examples of Bounded Linear Map

### 1. Shift Operator
[[Shift Operator]]



### 2. Multiplication Operator in $L^2(a, b)$
[[Multiplication Operator]]



### 3. Integration Map
[[Integration Map]]



### 4. Convolution Operator




## 3. Completeness of $B(X, Y)$.

Considering $Y$ as a [[Banach Space]], we consider the [[Completeness]] of $B(X, Y)$. One can derive an important conclusion that $B(X, Y)$ must be also [[Banach Space]].




## 4. Kernel and Range

Ker(T) provides a cerition to judge whether an operator is injective.


Here, the onto map has a represente as
$$\exists c > 0,\ \forall x \in X,\ \|Tx\|_Y \ge c\|x\|_X$$





## 5. Inverse and Invertibility

In the [[Category]] of [[Vector Space]], we consider the [[Invertible Map]], which must holds the [[Linearity]], and the [[Continuous Linear Map]] is equivalent to [[Bounded Linear Map]] in the [[Category]] of [[Vector Space]]. And the [[Continuous Linear Map]] is equivalent to [[Linear Map]] in the [[Category]] of [[Banach Space]], as the [[Sequential Continuity]]. 

Thus, every [[Bounded Linear Map]] with a [[Bounded Linear Map]] inverse must be the [[Bijection]] in the [[Category]] of [[Vector Space]].

And the [[Bijection]] in the [[Finite Vector Spaces]] is same to
