Assume $X, Y$ are two [[Normed Space]], $L(X, Y)$ is the [[Vector Space]] of all the [[Linear Map]] from $X$ to $Y$. The *operator norm* is defined as
$$\|T\|_{B(X, Y)} = \inf\{M: \|Tx\|_Y \le M \|x\|_X\}$$
one can check that the *operator norm* is actually a [[Norm]]. [[(Lemma) Operator Norm is Norm]].

The definition of *operator norm* is equivalent to
$$\|T\|_B := \sup_{x \in X}\frac{\|Tx\|_Y}{\|x\|_X}$$
with the help of linearity, which is also equivalent to
$$\|T\|_B := \sup_{x \in \mathbb B} \|Tx\|_Y$$
