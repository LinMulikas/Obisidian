The [[Banach Space]] is just the abbreviation of [[Complete]] [[Normed Space]].

The *completeness* of a [[Normed Space]] means every [[Cauchy Sequence]] is [[Convergent]]. The [[Complete]] [[Normed Space]] is called [[Banach Space]].

Firstly, we construct some basic abstract conclusion about [[Banach Space]]. Then we discuss some familiar space who are actually [[Banach Space]]. 

The last import theorem in this chapter is the [[Contraction Mapping Theorem]].

## 4.1 Banach Spaces

Firsly, we give the basic definiton of [[Complete]] and thus [[Banach Space]]. 

Then, an important conclusion is that the $\mathbb K$ is [[Banach Space]]. Thus, the [[Completeness]] is actually a [[Property]] that [[Cauchy Sequence]] incuces [[Convergence]] in [[Normed Space]]. 

Considering the [[Topology]] [[Construction]] of a space, a natural doubt is whether the [[Subspace]] and the [[Product Space]] hold the [[Completeness]]. And actually the concept [[Closed]], which requires the limit lies in the set ,connect the [[Convergence]] and [[Completeness]].

After it, we know that the [[Completeness]] is just convey by the [[Map]]. A natural idea is that will the [[Map]] acting on the space, who holds the [[Norm]] construction holds the [[Compactness]]? This induces a concept is that [[Isomorphic Normed Space]].

A rough think occurs here as the [[Isomorphism]] in [[Normed Space]] acturally holds the [[Construction]] of [[Norm]], and the [[Complete]] is nothing more than a [[Property]] of [[Order]] induces [[Convergence]], thus the [[Isomorphism in Normed Space]] holding the [[Equivalent Norms]] also holds the [[Completeness]].



## 4.2 Examples

Use the conclusion, we can check many spaces whether they are [[Banach Space]]. Here we give some important conclusion.

### 1. Sequence Spaces.

The [[Sequence Space]] with its standard norm is a [[Banach Space]], which can be proved with the help of the truth that $\mathbb K$ is [[Banach Space]] and the [[Completeness]] of [[Product Space]] requires every coordinate space must be [[Complete]].





### 2. Function Spaces.

The [[Norm]] as a [[Construction]] in [[Vector Space]] requires the finite value implicitly. Thus one should require the [[Bounded Linear Map]] when building the [[Normed Space]] of [[Map]]. The [[Sup Norm]] of a [[Map]] meets all the requirement of the special finte value norm.





## 4.3 Series view

In the history, *series* occurs as the corresponding concept with [[Sequence]], which can be seen another view of [[Sequence]].

Here, we give some conclusion in the view of [[Series]].

## 4.4 The Contraction Mapping Theorem

In the above content, we get the idea that use the *order hold* property as the [[Completeness]] construction. The [[Contraction Mapping Theorem]] just like the same property holds according to [[Map]].
