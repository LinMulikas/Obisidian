Considering the traingle inequality in *Number Field*
$$|x + y| \le |x| + |y|$$
We say a symmetric binary map satisfies the traingle inequality when
$$d(x, y) \le d(x, z) + d(y, z)$$

The property *Traingle Inequality* is a [[Construction]] of [[Map]], which may comes from the property of distance in real world.
