## 2.1 Metric Space

Equipped with [[Metric]] construction, the [[Topological Vector Space]] will be a [[Metric Space]]. Which has basic properties corresponding to the concept *distance* in *Eculidean Space*.

And here, we gave some examples of metric like the basic definition which actually induces the [[Lp Norm]], the [[Discrete Metric]].



## 2.2 Open and Closed

As the completeness of a book, here we introduces some basic properties about [[Topology]]. Including the basic [[Open]] and [[Closed]], also the usefull tool [[Open Ball]].

Then, use the [[Metric]], one can define the [[Convergent Sequence]]. And it has a different view in [[Topology]].

Also, one can define the [[Bounded Set]].

[[Closed]]

[[Convergent Sequence]]

[[(Lemma) Open, Closed is Sigma Algebra Closed]]





## 2.3 Continuity and Seqeuential Continuity

For the [[Map]], one can use the initial feel to define the concept [[Continuous Linear Map]]. And in the [[Topological]] view, its inverse holds the image open.






## 2.4 Interior, Closure, Density and Separability

Here, we introduces more [[Topological]] concept, which corresponding the [[Set]] conctruction.

Firtly, we define the [[Interior]], which is as important as the concept [[Limit Point]]. Then the [[Closure]] is the smallest [[Closed]] expansion. 

Thus we can consider the concept [[Dense]], which means the subset has the ability to expand to the bigger one. 

Considering the finite subset case, we give the concept [[Separable]].


## 2.5 Compactness

But the separability requires [[Countable]] [[Dense]] subset. It just like the [[Functional Analysis (by Robinson)/1. Vector Spaces/1.2 Linear Independent and Bases/Basis]] to [[Finite Vector Spaces]], which is weak than *finite*. Thus, use the [[Finite Subcover]] as the replacement of the *finite bases*, one can define the [[Compactness]].

Considering the [[Banach-Alaoglu Theorem]], which connected the [[Sequential Compactness]] and [[Compactness]]. Thus we can always use the [[Sequential Compactness]] to represente [[Compactness]], and the [[Sequence]] corresponding the [[Closed]], thus one can get many useful conclusion.

The [[Compact]] subset of a [[Metric Space]] induces it's also [[Closed]] [[Bounded Set]]. And a subset [[Compact]] [[Metric Space]] is [[Compact]] iff it's [[Closed]]. And for the $\mathbb K$, every [[Closed]] [[Bounded Set]] must be [[Compact]].
