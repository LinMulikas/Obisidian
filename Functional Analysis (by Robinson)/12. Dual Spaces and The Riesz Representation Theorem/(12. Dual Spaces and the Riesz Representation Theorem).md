## 1. Dual Sapces

Consinder all the bounded [[Linear Functional]] on $X$, name it as the [[Dual Space]] $X^*$, and equip it with the norm
$$\|f\|_{X^*} = \sup_{\|x\| = 1} |f(x)|,\ \forall f \in X^* $$

## 2. The Riesz Representation Theorem

In a [[Hilbert Space]], one can define a map use a vector and the [[Inner Product]]. And considering the map from vector to the map of vector, named it as [[Riesz Map]], the [[Riesz Map]] is onto, [[Isometric]], and be [[Linear]] when $H$ is over $\mathbb R$.

The [[Riesz Representation Theorem]] describe that every [[Linear Functional]] of a [[Hilbert Space]] can be written in a [[Inner Product]] form.
