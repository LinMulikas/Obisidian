An importante conclusion in [[Finite Dimension]] [[Vector Space]] is that all the [[Norm]]s are equivalent. Thus, all the construction based on the [[Equivalent Norms]] can be used in two [[Finite Dimension]] [[Normed Space]]. Thus, all the [[Finite Dimension]] [[Normed Space]] are [[Complete]] as they are [[Isomorphic]] to $\mathbb K$.

And also, in the finite dimension space, in ther view of [[Topology]], the compatness is same as bounded and closed. 

And the [[Linearity]] of [[Vector Space]] make it possible that check the [[Unit Ball]] to solve the whole space, which induces a rough idea that [[Compactness]] of [[Unit Ball]] derives the [[Finite Dimension]].

> Compactness is nothing more than the [[Finite Subcover]], which is same like the view of [[Functional Analysis (by Robinson)/1. Vector Spaces/1.2 Linear Independent and Bases/Basis]].


## 5.1 Equivalence of Norms in Finite-Dimension Spaces

In a word, the [[Finite Norm Spaces]] is [[Isomorphic Normed Space]] of standard space $\mathbb K^n$. This can be proved by the following step. Firstly, the important conclusion in [[Finite Vector Spaces]] is that it has finite numebr bases [[Construction]] , which induces the idea that use the [[Functional Analysis (by Robinson)/1. Vector Spaces/1.2 Linear Independent and Bases/Basis]] to derive the equivalence of [[Finite Norm Spaces]] and the standard number space $\mathbb K^n$.

Then, we can get the conclusion of $\mathbb K^n$ in the version of [[Finite Norm Spaces]].




## 5.2 Compactness of the Closed Unit Ball

Firstly, we give the *Riesz's Lemma*, which just a simple use of the [[Linearity]] and the [[Unit Ball]] of a [[Vector Space]]. We use the [[Property]] acturally corresponding to *Hausdorff Space* to choose a different point in $X$ and satisfy the distance inequality.(TODO)
