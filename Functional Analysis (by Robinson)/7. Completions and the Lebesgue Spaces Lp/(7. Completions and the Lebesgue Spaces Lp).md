In the above content, we know that $C([0, 1])$ is [[Complete]] in the [[Sup Norm]], but we will show that it's not [[Complete]] in other usual norm including the $L^1$ norm and other $L^p$ norm.

This motivate the abstract completion of a [[Normed Space]] and the *Lebesgue Integral*, and then define the $L^p$ space as the completion of the [[Continuous Function Space]] with the $L^p$ norm.
