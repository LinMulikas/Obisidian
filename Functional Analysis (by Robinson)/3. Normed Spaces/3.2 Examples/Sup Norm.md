Considering the *supremum norm* in a [[Vector Space]] $V$ by
$$\|\mathbf x\|_{\mathscr l ^\infty} := \sup_{i \in \mathbb N} |x_i|$$
where the $V$ may be infinite dimension. And then $V$ equipped with the *sup norm* is a [[Normed Space]].

The *sup norm* can be reduced into [[Maximum Norm]] in the [[Finite Dimension]].

The *sup norm* can defined on the operator in $V$ by
$$\|f\|_{\infty} = \sup_{x \in V}|f(x)|$$
in the finite interval case, also called *max norm*.
