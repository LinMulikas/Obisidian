Considering $X$ is a [[Normed Space]], with the [[Lp Norm]] $\mathscr{l}^p$, the *Finite Lp Norm Sequence Space*, or simply [[Sequence Space]] contains all [[Sequence]] $\mathbf x = (x_i)$ such that the norm of $\mathbf x$ is finite under the [[Lp Norm]], which means
$$\|\mathbf x\|_{\mathscr l^p} < \infty$$
