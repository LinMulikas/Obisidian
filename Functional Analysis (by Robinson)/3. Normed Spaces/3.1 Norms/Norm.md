A *norm* $\|\cdot\|$ is a [[Map]] from a [[Vector Space]] $X$ to non-negative real number, noted as $\|\cdot\|: X \to [0, \infty)$, for every $x, y \in X,\ t \in K$, which has the following properties
1. [[Definite]].
	$$\|x\| = 0 \iff x = 0$$
2. [[Linear]].
	$$\|tx\| = |t| \cdot \|x\|$$
3. [[Traingle Inequality]].
	$$\|x + y\| \le \|x\| + \|y\|$$
