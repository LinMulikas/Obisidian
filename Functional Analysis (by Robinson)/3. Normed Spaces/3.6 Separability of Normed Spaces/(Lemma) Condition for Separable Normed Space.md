The following three statements are equivalent
1. $X$ is a [[Separable Normed Space]].
2. There exist a [[Countable]] subset $\{x_i\}$, whose [[Closed Linear Span]] is [[Dense]] in $X$, as the [[Closed Linear Span]] is always [[Closed]], which is equivalent to its [[Closed Linear Span]] is just $X$ or its [[Linear Span]] is [[Dense]] in $X$.

3. The [[Unit Sphere]] of $X$ is [[Separable]].
	> This comes from the [[Linearity]], which is usefull in considering the whole space.

(Proof.)
> Firstly, 2 is the definition of 1.
> And acturally, the [[Linear Span]] of an [[Unit Ball]] is the whole space $X$. Thus, one can use this construction to get the equivalent of 1 and 3.
