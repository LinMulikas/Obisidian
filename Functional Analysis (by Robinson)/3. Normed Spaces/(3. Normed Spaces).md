## 3.1 Norms

Here, we define special map on [[Vector Space]] to real number as [[Norm]], a [[Vector Space]] equipped with norm is called [[Normed Space]]. 

One can found that a positive defined linear map with special condition [[(Lemma) Condition for induced norm]] induces a [[Norm]]. 

And the [[Norm]] can naturally induces a [[Metric]]. Thus every basic concept defined on [[Metric]] can be replaced by the [[Induced Metric of Norm]]. 

As a result [[p-th Power Summable Sequence Space]] can be modified as  [[Lp Norm]] easily.
## 3.2 Examples of Normed Spaces

Here, we give some examples of [[Norm]] and [[Normed Space]].

Firstly, the [[Lp Norm]] is norm as the corresponding [[p-th Power Summable Sequence Space]] with some modifies can be easily transformed into [[Norm]]. 

What's more, we introduced some special cases of the concept [[Lp Normed Space]], like [[Bounded Sequence Space]], [[Null Sequence Space]], which is similar as the cases in [[Vector Space]].
## 3.3 Convergence

Firstly, one can find the [[Reverse Traingle Inequality of Norm]], which also implies the [[Norm]] is a [[Continuous Linear Map]]. 

Then, one can find some result of concept [[Convergence]] corresponding the concept [[Norm]] as [[(Property) Convergence in Normed Space]], just comes from in the map view, [[Norm]] is a [[Continuous Linear Map]], thus it has the property [[Sequential Continuity]].
## 3.4 Equivalent Norms

Firstly, one can find that there exist many different norms in a same [[Normed Space]]. We define the [[Equivalent Norms]] to simplified the [[Equivalent Norms]] of [[Norm]], thus the definition make it a [[Equivalent Relationship]].

And the [[Equivalent Norms]] has the important topology property [[(Lemma) Equivalent Norms hold Open, Closed]], which can be used to solve a topological problem that may be hard on one norm but easy on another by changing the norm.
## 3.5 Isomorphism in Normed Spaces

Firstly, we consider the natural version of the concept [[Isomorphism]] in the [[Category]] of [[Normed Space]] by [[Isometric Isomorphism]]. 

Then the two sapces corresponding are called as [[Isometrically Isomorphic]]. 

However, the [[Construction]] is too [[Strict]], thus we use [[Equivalent Norms]] as the [[Equality Criterion]], which derives a [[Construction]] named [[Isomorphism in Normed Space]].
## 3.6 Separability of Normed Spaces

Considering the [[Functional Analysis (by Robinson)/1. Vector Spaces/1.2 Linear Independent and Bases/Basis]] concept corresponding to [[Vector Space]], one can define the [[Linear Span]]. Then, as a result, the concept [[Separable Metric Space]] corresponding to [[Finite Dimension]] [[Vector Space]], one can derive a version of [[Separable]] in [[Normed Space]] as [[Separable Normed Space]]. 

What's more, one can derives a import conclusion [[(Lemma) Condition for Separable Normed Space]] with the help of some contruction in [[Vector Space]], which is corresponding to some property of [[Unit Sphere]].
