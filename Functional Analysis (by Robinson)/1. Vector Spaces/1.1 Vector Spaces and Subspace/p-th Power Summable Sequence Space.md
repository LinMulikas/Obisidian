Considering $\mathscr l^p(\mathbb K)$, which is defined as the set of *p-th power summable sequence space*
$$\mathscr l^p(\mathbb K) := \{\mathbf x = (x_i) : x_i \in \mathbb K,\ \sum_{i = 1}^\infty |x_i|^p < \infty\}$$
One can check that the set is a [[Vector Space]].

In the case $p = \infty$, it's also called as [[Bounded Sequence Space]].
