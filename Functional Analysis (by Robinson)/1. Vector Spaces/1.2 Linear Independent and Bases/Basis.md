A subset $B$ of a [[Vector Space]] $V$ is [[Linearly Independent]] and [[Spanning Set]], here the [[Spanning Set]] may be infinite sum. 

And the finite case is called as a *hamel basis*. The infinite case is called as [[Schauder Basis]].

The *basis* in the book is the simple name of *hamel basis*.

Which means every $v \in V$ can be written as a [[Linear Combination]] of some finte elements of $B$.
