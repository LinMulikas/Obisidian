## 1.1 Vector Spaces and Subspace



## 1.2 Linear Independent and Bases



## 1.4 Spanning Set, Linear Independence and Bases

Firstlly, we define the [[Linear Span]] of a set. Then the special set spaning the whole [[Vector Space]], which is also called [[Spanning Set]], is of great importance. Also use the view of linearity, we define the [[Linearly Independent]].

Thus, the [[Functional Analysis (by Robinson)/1. Vector Spaces/1.2 Linear Independent and Bases/Basis]] can be constructed as the [[Linearly Independent]] [[Spanning Set]]. And according to some contradiction behind the 'independence' and 'spanning' induces the [[(Lemma) Maximal Linearly Independent Set is Hamel Basis]]. 

And in the finite cases, the number of elements in the [[Basis]] is same, see [[(Lemma) The Numebr of Elements of Finite Hamel Basis]]. The lemma give an idea that there exists some invariance in [[Vector Space]] with finite [[Basis]], we define it as [[Dimension]].


## 1.6 The existence of Hamel Bases

Use the [[Zorn's Lemma]], one can prove that every [[Vector Space]] has a [[Hamel Basis]].
